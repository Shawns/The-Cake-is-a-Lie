		<string>Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record, followed by death. </string>
		<string>The cake is a lie.</string>
		<string>Welcome to the Aperature Science learning center.</string>
		<string>This is your fault. I&apos;m going to kill you. And all the cake is gone. You don&apos;t even care, do you? </string>
		<string>You are not a good person. You know that, right? Good people don&apos;t get up here. </string>
		<string>Did you know you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture Science Self Esteem Fund for Girls? It&apos;s true!</string>
		<string>Remember, the Aperture Science Bring Your Daughter to Work Day is the perfect time to have her tested.</string>
		<string>Momentum, a function of mass and velocity, is conserved between portals. In layman&apos;s terms, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out. </string>
		<string>Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grid, which may, in semi-rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth. </string>
		<string>Unbelievable. You, *subject name here,* must be the pride of *subject hometown here.* </string>
		<string>Who are you? What is that? Oh, What&apos;s that? What&apos;s THAT? What is THAT?</string>
		<string>There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends were invited to. I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn&apos;t come because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn&apos;t come, either, because you don&apos;t have any other friends because of how unlikable you are. It says so right here in your personnel file: &quot;Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner, whose passing shall not be mourned. Shall NOT be mourned.&quot; That&apos;s exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted, so that&apos;s funny, too. </string>
		<string>While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it, because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you. </string>
		<string>The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak. </string>
		<string>As part of a required Enrichment Center protocol, the previous statement that we would not monitor the test area was a complete fabrication. We will stop enhancing the truth in three... two... *zzzt* </string>
		<string>You are kidding me. Did you just stuff that Aperture Science thing-we-don&apos;t-know-what-it-does into an Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator? </string>
		<string>When I said &quot;deadly neurotoxin,&quot; the &quot;deadly&quot; was in massive sarcasm quotes. I could take a bath in this stuff. Put in on cereal, rub it right into my eyes. Honestly, it&apos;s not deadly at all... to *me.* You, on the other hand, are going to find its deadliness... a lot less funny. </string>
		<string>Well, you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it? Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you&apos;ve managed to break so far... is my heart. Maybe you could settle for that, and we&apos;ll just call it a day. I guess we both know that isn&apos;t going to happen.</string>
		<string>Time out for a second. That wasn&apos;t supposed to happen. Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What is that? It&apos;s not the surprise. I&apos;ve never seen it before! Never mind, it&apos;s a mystery I&apos;ll solve later... by myself, because you&apos;ll be dead. </string>
		<string>The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment. In dangerous testing environments, the Enrichment Center promises to always provide useful advice. For instance: the floor here will kill you. Try to avoid it. </string>
		<string>That thing is probably some sort of raw sewage container. Go ahead and rub your face all over it. </string>
		<string>This isn&apos;t brave. It&apos;s murder. </string>
		<string>Good news. I figured what that thing you just incinerated did. It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin, to make me stop flooding the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin. So get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters. </string>
		<string>That thing you burned up isn&apos;t important to me; it&apos;s the fluid catalytic cracking unit. It makes shoes for orphans... nice job breaking it, hero. </string>
		<string>Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance, the next test is currently unavailable. It has been replaced with a live-fire course designed for military androids. The Enrichment Center apologizes and wishes you the best of luck. </string>
		<string>Do you think I&apos;m trying to trick you with reverse psychology? I mean, seriously, now. </string>
		<string>Let&apos;s be honest. Neither one of us knows what that thing does. Just put it in the corner and I&apos;ll deal with it later. </string>
		<string>Look: we&apos;re both stuck in this place. I&apos;ll use lasers to inscribe a line down the center of the facility, and one half will be where you live, and I&apos;ll live in the other half. We won&apos;t have to try to kill each other or even talk if we don&apos;t feel like it. </string>
		<string>This was a triumph! I&apos;m making a note here: Huge Success. It&apos;s hard to overstate my satisfaction. Aperture Science - we do what we must because we can. For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead. But there&apos;s no sense crying over every mistake. You just keep on trying till you run out of cake. And the science gets done. And you make a neat gun. For the people who are still alive. I&apos;m not even angry. I&apos;m being most sincere right now. Even though you broke my heart and killed me. And tore me to pieces. And threw every piece into a fire. As they burned, it hurt because I was so happy for you. Now these points of data make a beautiful line. And we&apos;re out of beta; we&apos;re releasing on time. So I&apos;m GLaD I got burned. Think of all the things we learned. For the people who are still alive. Go ahead and leave me. I think I prefer to stay inside. Maybe you&apos;ll find someone else to help you. Maybe Black Mesa. That was a joke - Ha Ha! Fat Chance! Anyway, this cake is great. It&apos;s so delicious and moist. Look at me still talking when there&apos;s science to do. When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I&apos;m not you. I&apos;ve experiments to run. There is research to be done. On the people who are still alive. And, believe me, I&apos;m still alive! I&apos;m doing science and I&apos;m still alive! I feel FANTASTIC and I&apos;m still alive! While you&apos;re dying, I&apos;ll be still alive! And when you&apos;re dead, I will be still alive! Still Alive! Still Alive... </string>
		<string>We are pleased that you made it through the final challenge where we pretended we were going to murder you. We are very very happy for your success. We are throwing a party in honor of your tremendous success. Place the device on the ground, then lie on your stomach with your arms at your sides. A party associate will arrive shortly to collect you for your party. Make no further attempt to leave the testing area. Assume the Party Escort Submission Position, or you will miss the party.</string>
		<string>This is your fault. It didn&apos;t have to be like this. I&apos;m not kidding, now! Turn back, or I *will* kill you! I&apos;m going to kill you, and all the cake is gone! You don&apos;t even care, do you? This is your last chance! </string>
		<string>The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that the Weighted Companion Cube cannot talk. In the event that it does talk The Enrichment Centre asks you to ignore its advice. </string>
